### Hey there 👋 I'm Sid

I'm an Engineering Manager at GitHub working on the CodeQL team supporting C# and Go. CodeQL is the engine that powers Code Scanning, and is a part of the GitHub Advanced Security organization.

I am passionate about building high-performing teams with high psychological safety 💪🧠. I started my career in software engineering working at MathWorks on Stateflow, a Model Based Design tool for modelling, simulation and generating code for State Machines. I moved to Canada 🇨🇦🍁 in 2018 to increase my exposure to distributed systems, and have worked at startups in the FinTech and EdTech spaces before coming to GitHub.

In my career, I've worked predominantly with C++, Javascript, Java and Python, but I have a special place in my heart for Scala, Rust and MATLAB. ❤️

### Fun facts about me:

- I am terrified of heights, but have been skydiving (AMA!) 🪂
- I love collecting currency notes, and have been collecting since I was 8 💷
- I love reading books, predominantly non-fiction and biographies, with anything written by Tolkien being an exception.
